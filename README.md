# Code + Brews

GA is taking an Oktoberfest tour and coming to a city near you! Hop over to your favorite local brewery for a beer and mini intro to coding lesson with our Web Development instructor. We'll teach you the basics and let you "code along" in a beer API with a cold IPA.

## Front-end

During the event, you'll walk students through the starter code. You might have to adjust depending on how much time you have to work with.

## Back-end

Although the front-end lives on Codepen, the app requires a server side proxy to the brewerydb API because it's not CORS enabled or supports JSONP as of this moment. The other reason why is because the API itself is not secure, whereas Heroku is.
