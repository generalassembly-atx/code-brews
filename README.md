# Code + Brews

GA is taking an Oktoberfest tour and coming to a city near you! Hop over to your favorite local brewery for a beer and mini intro to coding lesson with our Web Development instructor. We'll teach you the basics and let you "code along" in a beer API with a cold IPA.

## Back-end

Although the front-end lives on Codepen, the app requires a server side proxy to the brewerydb API because it's not CORS enabled or supports JSONP as of this moment.
